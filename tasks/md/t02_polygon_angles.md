# Task t02_polygon_angles

Claim: For any polygon with n >= 2 sides (including self-intersecting ones), the
sum of interior angles equals (n - 2) * pi.

Prove or disprove the claim. You must explicitly address the n = 2 case or explain
why it is excluded by definition. Your answer must include a verdict and a very
short proof sketch.

Required format:
- Verdict: true/false
- Proof sketch: 3-6 sentences
