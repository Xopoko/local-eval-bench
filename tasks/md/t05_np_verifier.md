# Task t05_np_verifier

Claim: A language L is in NP iff there exists a polynomial p and a polynomial-time
verifier V such that for all strings x,

  x in L  <=>  there exists y with |y| <= p(|x|) and V(x, y) = 1.

Prove or disprove the claim. Your answer must include a verdict and a very short
proof sketch.

Required format:
- Verdict: true/false
- Proof sketch: 3-6 sentences
