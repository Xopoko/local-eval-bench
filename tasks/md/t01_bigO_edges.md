# Task t01_bigO_edges

Claim: For all integers n >= 1, we have

  n^2 + n <= 1.5 * n^2

Therefore f(n) = n^2 + n is O(n^2) with constants C = 1.5 and n0 = 1.

Prove or disprove the claim. If it is false, give the smallest n0 that makes the
statement true for C = 1.5. Your answer must include a verdict and a very short
proof sketch.

Required format:
- Verdict: true/false
- Proof sketch: 3-6 sentences
