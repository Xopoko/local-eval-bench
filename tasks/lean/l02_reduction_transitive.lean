-- Task l02_reduction_transitive
-- Use ASCII only: forall, exists. Output Lean code only (no Markdown fences).
-- Assume the following names exist:
--   Language : Type
--   poly_time_reduction : Language -> Language -> Prop

-- Write a lemma statement and a proof sketch in Lean style.
-- Goal: poly_time_reduction is transitive.

-- Required format:
-- theorem/lemma ... : ... := by
--   -- proof sketch (tactics or comments)
